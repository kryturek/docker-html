# Trying out Docker for the first time

It's nothing specific, but I want to archive it in case I want to visit it later on.

Here I'm exploring the subject of containers, images, volumes, composing images, creating Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files, configuring nginx and working with nginx in general, connecting frontend, backend, and a database, all of them is separate containers. This little project also solidifies my understanding of Node.js, networking, and expands my knowledge on Linux distros.

.env.example is actually an exact copy of .env, I just don't want to push .env into a repo
